## Overview

Cancer prediction is a vital application of machine learning in healthcare, aiding in early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. This notebook uses Support Vector Machines, a robust and versatile supervised learning algorithm, to classify cancer cases based on various features.

---

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  Handles missing data, scales features, and prepares the dataset for model training.

- **Model Training**:  
  Implements the SVM algorithm with kernel options (e.g., linear, polynomial, RBF).

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:  
  Utilizes techniques like GridSearchCV for selecting optimal model parameters.

- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  Includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix for performance evaluation.

- **Visualization**:  
  Plots decision boundaries and confusion matrices to enhance interpretability.

---

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:

- `numpy`  
- `pandas`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `seaborn`  
- `scikit-learn`  

Install the required packages with:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

---

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdullahAlForman/SVM-Cancer-Prediction.git
   cd SVM-Cancer-Prediction
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Class-SVM-cancer.ipynb
   ```

3. Execute the cells step by step to replicate the workflow and results.

---

## Results

The notebook evaluates the SVM model's performance with metrics such as:  
- **Accuracy**: Measures overall prediction correctness.  
- **Precision**: Reflects the accuracy of positive predictions.  
- **Recall**: Indicates the model's ability to detect positive cases.  
- **F1-score**: Balances precision and recall.  

Confusion matrices and classification reports provide detailed insights into model predictions.
